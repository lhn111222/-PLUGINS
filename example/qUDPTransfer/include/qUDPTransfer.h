// First:
//	Replace all occurrences of 'qUDPTransfer' by your own plugin class name in this file.
//	This includes the resource path to info.json in the constructor.

// Second:
//	Open qUDPTransfer.qrc, change the "prefix" and the icon filename for your plugin.
//	Change the name of the file to <yourPluginName>.qrc

// Third:
//	Open the info.json file and fill in the information about the plugin.
//	 "type" should be one of: "Standard", "GL", or "I/O" (required)
//	 "name" is the name of the plugin (required)
//	 "icon" is the Qt resource path to the plugin's icon (from the .qrc file)
//	 "description" is used as a tootip if the plugin has actions and is displayed in the plugin dialog
//	 "authors", "maintainers", and "references" show up in the plugin dialog as well

/** Replace 'qUDPTransfer' by your own plugin class name throughout and then
	check 'qUDPTransfer.cpp' for more directions.

	Each plugin requires an info.json file to provide information about itself -
	the name, authors, maintainers, icon, etc..

	The one method you are required to implement is 'getActions'. This should
	return all actions (QAction objects) for the plugin. CloudCompare will
	automatically add these with their icons in the plugin toolbar and to the
	plugin menu. If	your plugin returns	several actions, CC will create a
	dedicated toolbar and a	sub-menu for your plugin. You are responsible for
	connecting these actions to	methods in your plugin.

	Use the ccStdPluginInterface::m_app variable for access to most of the CC
	components (database, 3D views, console, etc.) - see the ccMainAppInterface
	class in ccMainAppInterface.h.
